|8138 Click at a Symbol in the Thumbnail Picture

|8140 Set Type "Beacon", to send Symbol and Info
with your Position and Call with SSID. The
Symbol has the Call as Label and possibly
Altitute and Speed or Wx Data.
|8141 Set Type "Object" with HHMMSS Timestamp.
Send Object to set Symbol and object Name
to other as your Position. The Symbol shows
the Object Name (need not be a Callsign) as
label.
|8142 Set Type "Object" with DDHHMM Timestamp. 
|8143 Set Type "Item". This is like "Object"
but witout Timestamp and needs less bytes
with short Name and compressed position.
On Rf prefer this if no Time info needed.
|8144 Set Type "Delete Item". This wipes out
Items with This Name on all Maps. 
Important: Tx only once on Net or manual
a view times on Rf Ports.
|8145 Set Type "Delete Object". Depending on
Viewer should delete Items too.
 
|8150 Send normal DDMM.MM format, long, only
18m resolution but man-readable. May
be extendet with DAO to 20cm resolution
with "Lat/Long+" and 5 bytes more.
|8151 Send Mic-e format, this is compressed to
minimal size with 18m resolution and no
extra bytes for speed and course. May
contain not-printable characters so be
carefull by copy/edit raw data. May be
extendet with DAO to 20cm resolution
with "Mic-e+" and 5 Bytes more.
|8152 Send "Compressed" format, this is fixed size
and may contain speed/course OR (positive)
altitude but not both. If needs both, the
long /A=...... extention will be appended.
Resolution is 30cm
|8153 Same as "Lat/Long" but with DAO extention
if you need finer resolution than 18m.
|8154 Same as "Mic-e" but with DAO extention
if you need finer resolution than 18m.
